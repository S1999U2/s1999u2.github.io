      <description>Barclays and the Notch The iPhone X with the notch was released in November 2017, that&amp;rsquo;s more than 5.5 years ago. Somehow Barclays hasn&amp;rsquo;t gotten the news yet üôÑ.

      <description>Apple Weather Location Permissions Steve Jobs, in an interview at the D8 conference in June 2010:
Privacy means people know what they‚Äôre signing up for, in plain English and repeatedly
Of course, I want to know if an app tracks my location. But isn&amp;rsquo;t this getting a bit excessive? Besides, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ve already given Weather the Always Allow permission several times.
Weather has used your location 454 times in the background over the past 3 days.</description>

      <description>Hey Siri, Remind Me to‚Ä¶ Hey Siri, remind me to finish the exam and announcement when I get to work
Siri:
OK, Intercom to all
I‚Äôve created literally thousands of reminders with Siri. Siri correctly transcribed my instructions. For no apparent reason Siri utterly fails to set a reminder and sends my query to all the people in my home.
Intercom and remind me don‚Äôt even sound vaguely similar (neither in German nor in English).</description>

      <description>iOS 16.5 is Still Buggy After 16 years of working (more or less) flawlessly, iOS 16 breaks basic functionalities. With iOS 16.5 we&amp;rsquo;re 8 months into the iOS 16 release

      <description>Apple&amp;rsquo;s Privileges Since iOS and the App Store are Apple&amp;rsquo;s own platforms it gets special privileges and doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to follow its own rules. Ever seen any third-party app getting such a nice screen asking for permissions?
And how about the dark pattern highlighting the Enable Notifications‚Ä¶
Also: Not Now? How about never?
Apple gets special treatment when asking for permissions. </description>

      <description>Optimizing Your Mac A few days ago, I set up my newly purchased MacBook. So far, so good, but what does &amp;ldquo;Optimizing Your Mac&amp;rdquo; mean? I certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t notice any decreased performance or battery life, and I have some idea what it might be doing. But wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be convenient to provide some more details? Or maybe even see what my Mac is doing?

      <description>Hey Siri, What‚Äôs the Weather Like in Tokyo? Siri:
Here is the weather for Tokio, United States.
Obviously, people refer to Tokio, North Dakota (or Tokio, Texas) when they say &amp;ldquo;Tokyo.&amp;rdquo; (Even most of the US doesn&amp;rsquo;t refer to any of those two ü§∑).

      <description>Ads Are Ruining the App Store Hey, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be cool if Apple didn&amp;rsquo;t show the app I&amp;rsquo;m searching for both as a giant ad and as a search result?1
Ads are ruining Apple&amp;rsquo;s App Store. I understand that Crunchy Bagel, the app developer, is not to blame. I genuinely adore Streaks and all of the other apps they offer. You should definitely check them out.&amp;#160;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;</description>
