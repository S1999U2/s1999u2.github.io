<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>&ldquo;After Steve&rdquo; is a book that tells the story of Apple after the passing of Steve Jobs, following his top lieutenants, Jony Ive and Tim Cook, and how the fading of the former and the rise of the latter led to Apple losing its soul. The book is based on interviews with over 200 current and former Apple executives, including Trump administration officials and fashion luminaries such as Anna Wintour. It delves into how Cook, with his focus on maximizing margins, squeezed suppliers and forged global alliances, took over from Jobs, and oversaw a period of tremendous revenue growth, but at the cost of Apple&rsquo;s innovative spirit.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h4>
<p>This book is an exciting read for those who follow Apple closely. It casts light on behind the scenes at Apple and is a compelling read for all self-proclaimed Apple fans out there. Apparently, I gave 5 stars on Goodreads. Still, in retrospect, I&rsquo;d give it four stars (let&rsquo;s face it – a book about Apple can&rsquo;t be that good or profound to justify 5 stars.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2617.Jonathan_Safran_Foer">Jonathan Safran Foer</a></p>
<h4 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h4>
<p>Eating Animals is a book by Jonathan Safran Foer that examines the moral dimensions of food choices, particularly the consumption of animals. The book is part memoir and part investigative report, exploring the origins of eating traditions and the fiction that sustain them. Foer raises important questions about our dining habits and the ethical implications of consuming animals through his personal journey and research.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-1">Thoughts</h4>
<p>I have to admit something: I love eating meat. I like the taste, and I like the diversity of dishes. I like the cuisine and the culture surrounding meat products. But: I don&rsquo;t eat meat, and I&rsquo;ve basically been eating vegetarian since 2016. I may not be the target audience for this book. But it had nothing new to offer, and I didn&rsquo;t find the anecdotes entertaining or insightful. </p>

<h4 id="abstract-2">Abstract</h4>
<p>Guns, Germs, and Steel is a Pulitzer Prize-winning book by Jared Diamond that provides a global account of the rise of civilization. It argues that geographical and environmental factors played a crucial role in shaping the modern world and that societies that had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, developing writing, technology, government, and organized religion. The book refutes ideas of human development based on race. It is considered a major advance in our understanding of human societies.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-2">Thoughts</h4>
<p>This book is jam-packed with mind-blowing facts that it&rsquo;s hard to keep reading instead of delving into one Wikipedia rabbit hole after another. One of my instant favorites.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2790706.Hans_Rosling">Hans Rosling</a></p>
<h4 id="abstract-3">Abstract</h4>
<p>This book is the memoir of Hans Rosling, a statistics mastermind, researcher, and author of the global bestseller &ldquo;Factfulness.&rdquo; It details his journey of becoming a revolutionary thinker. It takes readers from an emergency clinic in Mozambique to the World Economic Forum in Davos. Written with the same storytelling joy that made Rosling a popular speaker, it is a book that contains few numbers. It focuses on the people who inspired and educated him.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-3">Thoughts</h4>
<p>Hans Rosling has taught me, and many others, to look for the data and not be misguided by stereotypes and outdated worldviews. This book is definitely more of a biography than educational. But Hans Rosling had a fascinating life worth reading</p>

<h4 id="abstract-4">Abstract</h4>
<p>Money Men is a book that tells the story of the collapse of Wirecard, a tech company that was once worth $30 billion. Journalist Dan McCrum, who followed a tip to investigate the company, found that everything about Wirecard looked too good to be true. The book delves into the world of short sellers, whistleblowers, hackers, spies, and more as McCrum uncovers a story of fraud and deception. The book is an inside look at Wirecard&rsquo;s multi-billion dollar fraud. It offers a searing exposé that will finally lay bare the truth.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-4">Thoughts</h4>
<p>I know, I know. This <em>scandal</em> thing is getting out of hand. But also: Wirecard is a unique case in modern German history – with open questions still. On the other hand, I found this one a bit over the top. If this is the correct term, the plot is hard to follow, and sometimes you wonder how on earth the author is supposed to know what some banker thought 10 years ago. Also, this one feels too much like patting himself on the back for &ldquo;I told you so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edward Snowden&rsquo;s memoir, Permanent Record, details his life story, including his role in building the US government&rsquo;s mass surveillance system and his decision to expose it to the world.

It&rsquo;s an intimate and candid account of his journey from being an intelligence insider to becoming a whistleblower.</p>

<h4 id="abstract-7">Abstract</h4>
<p>The Afghanistan Papers is a book by Craig Whitlock that exposes the deception of the US government regarding the war in Afghanistan. It is based on interviews with over 1,000 people directly involved in the war and documents that reveal the true extent of the failure of strategies, nation-building, and the impact of drugs and corruption on the Afghan government. The book is a damning indictment of senior military and civilian officials&rsquo; deceit, blunders, and hubris. It will change the way the conflict is remembered.</p>

<h4 id="abstract-9">Abstract</h4>
<p>In &ldquo;The Wizard and the Prophet,&rdquo; Charles Mann explores the conflicting ideologies of two 20th-century scientists, Norman Borlaug and William Vogt, whose views on the environment and population growth shape our understanding of the world today. Mann delves into the opposing viewpoints of &ldquo;Wizards&rdquo; who believe in innovation and progress and &ldquo;Prophets&rdquo; who advocate for conservation and limitations and examines the impact these ideologies have on addressing the challenges of food, water, energy, and climate change in the face of a rapidly growing population. Mann provides historical context and examines potential solutions for the future in this insightful analysis of a crucial topic.</p>

<p>Deutschland, ein Wirtschaftsmärchen: Warum es kein Wunder ist, dass wir reich wurden</p>
<h4 id="abstract-13">Abstract</h4>
<p>Ulrike Herrmann&rsquo;s book debunks myths and legends of the German economic miracle, revealing that it is not due to the supposed &ldquo;father&rdquo; of the economic miracle Ludwig Erhard, or the Bundesbank, but instead harms society by benefiting the rich and causing unemployment. The book also claims that real successes, such as reunification, were not costly and that it&rsquo;s time to move on from these legends to understand our future.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-13">Thoughts</h4>
<p>I have to admit, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of economics. And I&rsquo;m not sure economists still active in the field would agree with the author. Still, I found this book an interesting read as it gave me a new perspective on the German post world war II economy.</p>

<p>Die Cum-Ex-Files: Der Raubzug der Banker, Anwälte und Superreichen - und wie ich ihnen auf die Spur kam</p>
<h4 id="abstract-14">Abstract</h4>
<p>This book exposes the largest theft of taxpayers&rsquo; money in European history. The book is written by Oliver Schröm, who led a team of journalists from 12 countries to uncover the European dimension of the century-long scandal. The book is an account of the author&rsquo;s often adventurous research, in which he becomes both hunter and hunted, revealing the involvement of wealthy investors, bankers, lawyers, and politicians in the Cum-Ex-Deals.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-14">Thoughts</h4>
<p>Most certainly the largest theft ever exposed – probably (maybe?) legal because the powerful in politics are also involved. Sometimes the sheer size of this crime is hard to grasp.</p>

<p>Die Ibiza-Affäre: Innenansichten eines Skandals</p>
<h4 id="abstract-15">Abstract</h4>
<p>This book tells the story of the rise of two right-wing populists in Austria and exposes the entire course of the affair that resulted in the downfall of the government. It reveals the behind-the-scenes of the biggest political crisis in post-war Austria.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-15">Thoughts</h4>
<p>Interesting read of a fascinating story that made the news world wide. Don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way, but I found this book a bit less engaging and a bit more entertaining, as I&rsquo;m not Austrian and I&rsquo;m not <em>that</em> into Austrian politics.</p>

<h4 id="abstract-16">Abstract</h4>
<p>The Panama Papers is an investigative book based on the largest data leak in history. It reveals how the world&rsquo;s wealthiest individuals and companies use complex networks of letterbox companies to hide their money. The book follows the journalists who uncovered the story, including their struggles and challenges, as they uncovered cases involving European prime ministers, dictators, emirs, kings, celebrities, and aristocrats. The book is an intense, unputdownable account that exposes the secret world of the elite and their different set of rules.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-16">Thoughts</h4>
<p>Okay, okay. Who am I kidding? Scandalous books are my guilty pleasure, okay? I know it&rsquo;s not better than <em>True Crime</em>, but that&rsquo;s what it took to get me into reading again.</p>

<p>Die Akte Scholz: Der Kanzler, das Geld und die Macht</p>
<h4 id="abstract-17">Abstract</h4>
<p>The book &ldquo;The Scholz File: The Chancellor, the Money, and the Power&rdquo; provides a unique insight into the role of Olaf Scholz, the current Chancellor of Germany, in the 47-million-euro tax gift to a private bank while he was the Mayor of Hamburg. The book reveals the reality behind the scenes, how the Chancellor and his associates act under pressure, and a system of dependencies, questionable alliances, small and big lies, and manipulation of public opinion.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-17">Thoughts</h4>
<p>After over 16 years as Chancellor of Germany, Angela Merkel was succeeded by Olaf Scholz from the Social Democratic Party of Germany. But unlike Angela Merkel (aka the &ldquo;nonstick pan&rdquo;) has had multiple scandals in his political career. This book gives a detailed account of Scholze&rsquo;s wrongdoings, his rise to power, and how his frails seemingly don&rsquo;t seem to matter.</p>
