      <description>Welcome to &amp;ldquo;Things I Learned in 2022&amp;rdquo;! In this post, I&amp;rsquo;ll be sharing a list of things that stood out to me as I read and listened to various sources throughout the year. These are things that I found noteworthy and thought-provoking, and I&amp;rsquo;ve included sources for each item as well as summaries of the linked articles or topics for those who are interested in more than just the headline. If you happen to notice any errors, you can reach me on Mastodon at @Secundus@home.</description>
