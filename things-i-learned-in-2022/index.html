  <p>Welcome to &ldquo;Things I Learned in 2022&rdquo;!
In this post, I&rsquo;ll be sharing a list of things that stood out to me as I read and listened to various sources throughout the year. These are things that I found noteworthy and thought-provoking, and I&rsquo;ve included sources for each item as well as summaries of the linked articles or topics for those who are interested in more than just the headline. If you happen to notice any errors, you can reach me on Mastodon at¬†<a href="https://home.social/@Secundus">@Secundus@home.social</a>. Without further ado, let&rsquo;s dive into the list of 95 things I learned in 2022!</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://phys.org/news/2021-05-mammals-anus-emergencies.html">Mammals can breathe through their anus üí®üêÄüê∑üç©.</a></p>
<p>A new study found that mammals like rodents and pigs can use their intestines for respiration. The researchers demonstrated that the delivery of oxygen gas or oxygenated liquid through the rectum provided vital rescue to two mammalian models of respiratory failure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first cheese eaten by humans might have been discovered in killed animals like young deer that had partially fermented milk in their intestines üßÄü¶åü§¢.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-11-02/china-climate-goals-hinge-on-440-billion-nuclear-power-plan-to-rival-u-s?sref=Yg3sQEZ2&amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">China is planning over 150 new nuclear reactors in the next 15 years ‚Äì more than the rest of the world has built in the past 35 years üá®üá≥üè≠‚ò¢Ô∏è.</a></p>
<p>This undertaking could cost $440 billion. China is expected to surpass the US as the largest nuclear power generator by the middle of this decade.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XimGagIVHc">Los Angeles has a massive oil industry inside its city üèôÔ∏èüõ¢Ô∏è.</a></p>
<p>In the city of Los Angeles, thousands of oil wells are hidden between caf√©s and bookstore-caf√©s producing petroleum. For most of the city&rsquo;s history, the oil industry was visible. However, as public sentiment turned against the oil rigs, petroleum companies built oil derricks that looked like synagogues or other innocuous buildings. While this solution worked for a while, the people of LA eventually grew tired of their city&rsquo;s industrial look, so they started to cover up the oil rigs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU2rLhpaMAY">Himalayan giant bees form a superorganism by buzzing in sync. They do this to defend themselves from enemies such as hornets üêùüí§.</a></p>
<p>The bees synchronize the movements of their abdomen, which is used as a form of defense against predators. While Hornets cannot defeat these bees by themselves, they can still cause significant damage by attacking individual bees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption">This probably isn&rsquo;t news to anyone, but mining bitcoin uses a staggering amount of energy ‚ö°.</a></p>
<p>At an estimated energy consumption of 204 TWh/year, Bitcoin&rsquo;s carbon footprint in mid-2022 was between the electricity consumption of South Africa (210 TWh/year, 60 million people) and Thailand (185 TWh/year, 69 million people). At the same time, a single Bitcoin transaction has a carbon footprint equivalent to 918,135 VISA transactions or 69,043 hours of watching YouTube. The electrical energy used for a single Bitcoin transaction is equivalent to the power consumption of an average US household over 25.46 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/the-h-word/2013/jul/08/influenza-virus-discovery-mrc-nimr">The viral cause of influenza (and the Spanish Flu) was discovered just 90 years ago üò∑ü¶†.</a></p>
<p>In 1933, a team of researchers identified a virus as the primary cause of influenza. This discovery resulted from a sustained campaign of funding and research that began in 1918 when the influenza pandemic challenged the belief that bacteria caused influenza. The researchers used ferrets in their experiments. Their success in developing a vaccine for ferrets in 1926 and modifying it for dogs in 1927 legitimized the National Institute of Medical Research&rsquo;s approach to virus diseases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/wmo-certifies-two-megaflash-lightning-records">There are new records for the longest distance lightning and the longest duration lightning. The record now is a distance of 768 ¬± 8 km (477.2 ¬± 5 miles)¬†and a duration of 17.102 ¬± 0.002 seconds ‚ö°üå©Ô∏èüåé.</a></p>
<p>The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) has recognized two new world records for megaflashes of lightning in North and South America. The records were established using the latest satellite technology. The record for the longest single flash covered a horizontal distance of 768 km (477.2 miles) across the southern United States on 29 April 2020, while the record for the greatest duration for a single lightning flash was 17.102 seconds from a flash that developed continuously over Uruguay and northern Argentina on 18 June 2020. Both records occurred in hotspots for Mesoscale Convective System thunderstorms, where extraordinary megaflashes can occur.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://ciechanow.ski/gps/">The Global Positioning System (GPS) is marvelous. And this explainer really goes into the details of the inner workings of it (for example, why are four satellites required even though three should be enough to determine the position on a sphere) üõ∞Ô∏è</a></p>
<p>GPS works by using a network of satellites orbiting the Earth that transmit signals down to the surface. Receivers then use the time delay between transmission and reception to calculate the distance to the satellite. By measuring the distance to at least four satellites, the location can be determined using trilateration.
But this summary doesn&rsquo;t do Bartosz Ciechanowski&rsquo;s piece justice ‚Äì you really should give it a read (and all his <a href="https://ciechanow.ski/archives/">other posts</a> too)!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.sfhscollegeprep.org/news-detail?pk=1237113">The US owns and stores 1.4 billion pounds (640 million kg) of cheese üá∫üá∏üßÄ.</a></p>
<p>The cheese is stored hundreds of feet below ground in converted limestone mines in Missouri, referred to as &ldquo;cheese caves.&rdquo; This excess of cheese began in the 1970s when the government provided over 2 billion dollars to the dairy industry to increase production and lower the 30% inflation on dairy products. However, this led to overproduction and the government purchasing excess cheese to keep prices low. By 2019, dairy consumption was less than half it was thirty years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211112-the-people-with-immune-amnesia">Measles Infection can cause the immune system to be &ldquo;reset&rdquo; ‚Äì prior immunities must be almost entirely re-learned ü¶†.</a></p>
<p>Measles causes &ldquo;immune amnesia,&rdquo; a phenomenon where the immune system forgets all the pathogens it has encountered before the measles infection. This means that the body has to start again to learn what is good and bad. The phenomenon is thought to have been with us for millennia but was only discovered in 2012. It is unknown how long immune amnesia lasts, and some studies suggest it could be driving other epidemics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlPm7JtaxE4">The Word <em>broadcasting</em> comes from the scattering of seeds (wheat) across the field üåæüå±üßë‚Äçüåæ.</a></p>
<p>In this video, the author describes how to grow wheat and turn it into bread. He talks about the history of wheat cultivation, the problems with the green revolution, and how Norman Borlaug helped solve those problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=en7hhFJBrAI&amp;">The mirrors (by Zeiss) that ASML will use for its wide aperture EUV lithography process must have a maximum of 1 pm aberrations at a diameter of 1 m ‚Äì this equals aberrations the size of a human hair relative to the size of the Earth ü™ûü¶±üåç.</a></p>
<p>ASML is developing the next generation of its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines, which will be faster and more precise than the current generation. The biggest challenge for EUV is throughput or the number of wafers a single machine can produce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvEk6QsNuRA">TSMCs requirements for cleanliness in their EUV lithography are insane ü§Ø.</a></p>
<p>TSMC&rsquo;s Giga-Fabs are complex, expensive chip manufacturing facilities that give them a competitive advantage over other companies. They offer a service that allows multiple customers to share the cost of putting new chips on a single wafer, helping smaller companies stay competitive. TSMC has also improved in cycle times, making them a leader in the foundry business.
Clean rooms are one of the main drivers of fab expense. In the early phase of EUV production TSMC required less than one particle over 52 nm wide (the size of a small virus) each week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGPQ5kzJ9Tg">Transient Luminous Events are amazing ‚õàÔ∏è.</a></p>
<p>Red sprites are large-scale electrical discharges that occur high in the atmosphere during clear weather conditions. They are related to blue jets and blue starters, which are also atmospheric discharges. A new discovery has shown that ghost-like emissions can be produced by excited oxygen molecules in red sprites and blue jets, similar to green sprites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/no-way">Almonds and peaches are so genetically similar they can fertilize each other and produce viable hybrids üå∞üçë.</a>
Researchers at the Centre for Research in Agricultural Genomics have sequenced the genome of the almond tree and compared it to the genome of the peach tree. They found almond and peach trees had a common ancestor ~6 million years ago.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-xyXDiC92s">The Soyuz rockets are to this day lighted using basically giant wooden matchsticks üöÄüß®.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvmAaXUKkco">The¬†Vulcan salute¬†(üññ ‚Äì &ldquo;live long and prosper&rdquo;) is at least 2,600 years old.</a></p>
<p>If a Cohanim (Jewish priest) gives you a blessing, he holds his hands like this. And the young  Leonard Nimoy saw this as a child and was later inspired by it and popularized it in the 1960s in the television series Star Trek.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.quora.com/Where-can-the-authentic-manuscript-of-Commentari-de-Bello-Gallico-written-by-Gaius-Julius-Caesar-be-found">The original manuscripts of Caesar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Commentari de Bello Gallico&rdquo; are long gone. The oldest surviving book-length manuscripts are almost always later than the sixth century CE üèõÔ∏è.</a></p>
<p>The majority of our ancient texts are no older than the tenth century. Scroll-based books were delicate and cumbersome. When bound books became available, people stopped preserving scrolls. They discarded them once they had been copied into the more convenient and durable bound format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Bv8g5xBJSo">Saturn&rsquo;s rings form a disc wider than Jupiter while on average being only 10 meters thick ü™ê.</a></p>
<p>Saturn&rsquo;s rings are made up of small, icy particles that range in size from dust grains to boulders. They are thought to be composed primarily of water ice, with small amounts of other materials such as silicates and organics. They are believed to have formed from a shattered moon or comet that got too close to Saturn and was torn apart by its gravity. The particles in the rings then began to orbit Saturn, forming the current ring system. It is unclear exactly how old the rings are or how they will evolve over time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IV3dnLzthDA">Lead concentration in ice cores reveals the rise and fall of Greek and Roman empires üèõÔ∏èüè∫üßä.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=klaJqofCsu4">Philips manufactures unique, energy-efficient Dubai lamps with long lifespans available nowhere else üá¶üá™üí°.</a></p>
<p>The <em>Dubai lamps</em> are only widely available in Dubai and are expensive to manufacture. They use flip-chip style LEDs and have a long lifespan, lasting 50,000 hours without needing to be replaced. They are also energy efficient, using less than $5 of power over four and a half years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://undark.org/2022/03/25/the-parable-of-the-worlds-largest-bee/">The largest bee in the world was believed to be extinct until it was rediscovered in 2019 üêù.</a></p>
<p>Wallace&rsquo;s giant bee, the largest bee in the world, was rediscovered by a team of researchers in the Indonesian islands of North Maluku. The bee had not been seen alive since 1981 and was found in a termite nest. It was named after Alfred Russel Wallace, a contemporary of Charles Darwin who studied it in the 1800s. The bee was also known as the &ldquo;Hitler bee&rdquo; due to a rare beetle with a similar name being popular with Nazi collectors. The rediscovery of the bee gained worldwide media attention, and Indonesian officials pledged to conduct a thorough survey of the species. However, the bee&rsquo;s existence also attracted attention from the illegal animal trade, with a specimen sold on eBay for thousands of dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4aUODXeAM-k">Nuclear Power is not as bad as many belief üè≠üîå.</a></p>
<p>For example, one coal plant puts over 100 times more radiation into the air than a nuclear plant. Additionally, coal plant pollution (ash) put into the air by the US alone amounts to 130,000,000,000 kg annually, while all of the nuclear waste ever produced in total amasses to about 450,000,000 kg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://thewhippet.org/145-another-day-in-the-art-mines/">25% of the world&rsquo;s sheep population are fat-tailed sheep, storing body fat in their bum‚Äì they&rsquo;re bad for wool but are adorable to look at üêëüê´.</a></p>
<p>Camels have humps to store fat as an energy source, but they also have them to prevent overheating. Fat-tailed sheep, a type of domesticated sheep found in hot climates, also store their fat away from the core of their body to prevent overheating. These sheep comprise 25% of the world&rsquo;s sheep population. They are found in northern Africa, the Middle East, India, Bangladesh, Western China, Somalia, and Central Asia. Many breeds of fat-tailed sheep have hair instead of wool due to their evolution in hot climates.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-doesnt-make-videogames-but-its-the-hottest-player-in-gaming-11633147211?st=x3tad5ypqtit2gk&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink">Apple earns more from gaming than Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Activision combined üçéüéÆ.</a></p>
<p>It is estimated that the App Store generated $15.9 billion in revenue in a year, with 69% of that revenue coming from gaming ($10.97 billion).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/AstroKatie/status/1516548836709343238">Distant galaxies appear larger in the sky than closer galaxies of the same size due to cosmic expansion üåå‚ú®.</a></p>
<p>In general relativity, it is observed that distant galaxies appear larger in the sky than closer galaxies of the same size. This is because light from distant galaxies is from a time when the universe was much smaller, so the galaxies were much closer and covered more of the sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2622/">This phenomenon is called <em>Angular Diameter Turnaround</em> and it is mindblowing üóúÔ∏èü§Ø.</a></p>
<p>It is useful for astronomers because it allows them to observe details in distant galaxies that would otherwise be too small to see. However, the sky is not full of distant objects because of the faintness and stretching of light from distant objects, the limited number of galaxies beyond a certain point, and the cosmic microwave background.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZClwTMT26s">Bacteria can be classified by their shape ü¶†üî¨.</a></p>
<p>Common types are <em>coccus</em> (Greek for <em>grain</em>) or <em>bacillus</em> (Greek for <em>rod</em>). <em>Strepto</em> means <em>chain</em> so <em>streptococcus</em> is a chain of <em>coccus</em> forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZClwTMT26s">Botox is by far the most poisonous and the most expensive substance ‚ò†Ô∏èüí∏.</a></p>
<p>The bacteria producing Botulinum toxin (Botox) is called <em>Clostridium botulinum</em>. Botox is the most poisonous substance known. 70 ng (1.5e-10 lb) can kill you. Furthermore, it is also the most expensive substance at ~ $100 trillion per kg ($45 trillion per lb).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.scanofthemonth.com/scans/ipod-evolution">Steve Jobs dunked an iPod in an aquarium to show that it could be made smaller ü™∏.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/flour">Flour was spelled <em>flower</em> until ca. 1830 üßë‚Äçüç≥.</a></p>
<p>The spelling of the word &ldquo;flour&rdquo; was once &ldquo;flower,&rdquo; and it referred to the finest portion of ground grain, similar to the French term &ldquo;fleur de farine.&rdquo; This word is a doublet of &ldquo;flower,&rdquo; partially replacing the native word &ldquo;meal.&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbellaria">There are more species of the <em>Turbellaria</em> flatworms  alone (approx. 4,500) than there are of all mammals combined ü™±üêò.</a></p>
<p>Turbellaria is a type of flatworm that is not a parasite. They are found in water or moist environments and are usually predators. They reproduce sexually and are hermaphrodites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dynomight.net/aspartame/">Half of the world&rsquo;s aspartame production is by the same company that ‚Äûinvented‚Äú MSG üç¨üßÇ.</a></p>
<p>Aspartame is a synthetic sweetener. When consumed, it is quickly broken down in the gut into three chemicals: phenylalanine, aspartic acid, and methanol. Phenylalanine is an essential amino acid found in most protein-containing foods. At the same time, aspartic acid is a non-essential amino acid also found in protein-containing foods and produced naturally by the body.

<p>The Greek word for fennel is &ldquo;marathon,&rdquo; which refers to a field covered in wild fennel. It was also used to name the village and the battle that took place there, approximately 42 km from Athens. The legendary messenger Pheidippides ran from the battlefield to Athens to announce the victory of the Athenians over the Persians in 490 BCE.

<ul>
<li><em>Anthocyanin</em> is the pigment that turns wine red. It fades or turns brown over time ‚ûù Younger wines tend to be more intensely red</li>
<li>The amount of anthocyanin depends on the climate
<ul>
<li>Warm climates typically have more pigment and are more opaque</li>

<li>Marangoni effect or <em>Tears of wine</em>
<ul>
<li>The more individual droplets, the higher the alcohol content</li>
<li>The slower the droplets move, the higher the sugar content</li>
<li>Explanation:
Alcohol has lower surface tension and higher volatility than water. The water/alcohol solution rises up the surface of the glass, lowering the surface energy of the glass. Alcohol evaporates from the film, leaving the liquid with a higher surface tension (more water, less alcohol). This region with a lower concentration of alcohol (greater surface tension) pulls on the surrounding fluid more strongly than the regions with a higher alcohol concentration (lower in the glass). The result is the liquid is pulled up until its own weight exceeds the force of the effect.</li>

<p>Non-water floods typically occur when liquids are released from storage facilities or when toxic waste is released from industrial retaining reservoirs. These types of incidents can be catastrophic, especially if they occur in cities. For example, the Great Molasses Flood of 1919 in Boston, US, was caused by the failure of a molasses tank and resulted in 21 deaths. Industrial retaining reservoirs that fail can flood large areas and cause physical and environmental damage. The Ajka alumina plant failure in Hungary in 2010 and the Kingston Fossil Plant spill in Tennessee, US, in 2008 are examples of this. The cleanup from the Kingston Fossil Plant spill took several years and resulted in the deaths of at least 40 workers.</p>

<p>Before this time, rabbits were primarily kept as pets or for their fur. It was not until the growth of monasteries in the middle ages that rabbits began to be kept for their meat.</p>

<p>Before this time, Hamsters were primarily found in the wild and were not kept as domestic pets. The Syrian Hamster was the first species to be domesticated, followed by the Russian Dwarf Hamster and the Chinese Hamster.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest#Name">Sir George Everest was against naming Mount Everest after him ‚õ∞Ô∏èüèîÔ∏è.</a></p>
<p>The British survey wanted to preserve local names for mountains in 1849, but couldn&rsquo;t find a commonly used name, so naming the mountain after Sir George Everest was proposed. Despite objections from Everest himself, the Royal Geographical Society officially adopted Mount Everest&rsquo;s name in 1865.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Everest#Name">Mount Everest&rsquo;s pronunciation differs from the pronunciation of Sir George&rsquo;s surname üó£üá¨üáß.</a></p>
<p>The modern pronunciation of Mount Everest is /evarist/ (ee-VAR-ist), while the pronunciation of Sir George&rsquo;s surname was /&lsquo;ivrist/ (EEV-rist).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/1/6/22215728/senate-anti-democratic-one-number-raphael-warnock-jon-ossoff-georgia-runoffs">The US Senate is unfairly proportioned, giving small states like Wyoming the same number of senators as large states like California, which has about 68 times as many residents üá∫üá∏‚öñÔ∏è.</a></p>
<p>This gives an advantage to Republicans in controlling the upper house. As of 2021, the Democratic half of the Senate represents 41,549,808 more people than the Republican half.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defenestration">Defenestration is a thing ‚Äì¬†throwing someone or something out of a window ü§¨ü™üü§∏.</a></p>
<p>The word comes from the Latin <em>de</em>- (down from) and <em>fenestra</em> (window or opening). Notable examples of defenestration include the assassination of William Douglas, 8th Earl of Douglas, by King James II of Scotland in 1452, the St. Bartholomew&rsquo;s Day massacre in 1572, and the assassination of Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement, in 1844.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFZxlauizx0">Smartwatches flash their light on and off (when measuring the pulse or blood oxygen) to subtract ambient light (during the <em>off</em> phase) ‚åöüî¶üíï.</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFZxlauizx0">Smartwatches measure breathing rate by measuring pulse. When the lungs expand during inhalation, the space within the chest becomes smaller, causing the volume of the heart to decrease. As a result, the heart must beat faster to maintain the same blood flow throughout the body üòÆ‚Äçüí®ü´Å.</a></p>
<p>Blood oxygen is measured by using two effects. 1. Oxygenated blood is redder due to the presence of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. 2. Oxygenated blood absorbs less infrared light than deoxygenated blood. By combining the measurement of reflected red light and infrared light, it is possible to determine the oxygenation level of the blood. The relationship between the two light sources can be used to determine the oxygenation level, even if the ambient light or the position of the device changes. Varying ambient light or the device&rsquo;s position, the two light intensities may move relative to each other. But the direction of their movement will depend on the oxygen concentration of the blood.</p>

<p><a href="https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/the-truth-about-cats-and-dogs-environmental-impact">If cats and dogs in the US were a country, they would rank fifth in global meat consumption. They also produce as much feces as 90 million Americans üêàüêïüçñüá∫üá∏.</a></p>
<p>According to a study by UCLA, cats and dogs contribute to 25 to 30% of the environmental impact of meat consumption in the United States. Meat consumption by dogs and cats creates the equivalent of about 64 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, which has the same climate impact as a year&rsquo;s worth of driving from 13.6 million cars.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.southernliving.com/food/kitchen-assistant/why-is-pounds-abbreviated-lbs">The abbreviation &ldquo;lb&rdquo; for pound comes from the Latin word &ldquo;libra,&rdquo; which was used in the ancient Roman phrase &ldquo;libra pondo,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;a pound by weight&rdquo; üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚öñÔ∏èüí∑¬£.</a></p>
<p>The abbreviation &ldquo;oz&rdquo; for ounce comes from the Latin word &ldquo;uncia,&rdquo; which was borrowed by Medieval Italian and shortened to &ldquo;onza,&rdquo; introducing the &ldquo;z&rdquo; into the word. These abbreviations were likely adopted in English because of their historical usage in measuring weight and length. The British pound (¬£) symbol also comes from the Latin word &ldquo;libra&rdquo; and originally represented the value of a pound of silver.</p>
