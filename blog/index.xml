      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m glad I got into reading more books again in 2022.

Also, I&amp;rsquo;m a terribly slow reader, which is just unbearable when I see people casually reading twice as fast as me. Still, I found great satisfaction in committing and extending my attention span beyond the instant rewards of today&amp;rsquo;s internet.</description>
