      <description>Apple Weather Location Permissions Steve Jobs, in an interview at the D8 conference in June 2010:
Privacy means people know what theyâ€™re signing up for, in plain English and repeatedly
Of course, I want to know if an app tracks my location. But isn&amp;rsquo;t this getting a bit excessive? Besides, I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ve already given Weather the Always Allow permission several times.
Weather has used your location 454 times in the background over the past 3 days.</description>

      <description>iOS 16.5 is Still Buggy After 16 years of working (more or less) flawlessly, iOS 16 breaks basic functionalities. With iOS 16.5 we&amp;rsquo;re 8 months into the iOS 16 release
Screen rotation is still broken in iOS 16.5. </description>

      <description>Apple Knows How to Make the App Store a Premium Experience First, Apple is explicitly showing me something I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for.
Second, Apple knows Audible is already installed and decides to show me the ad anyway.

      <description>Ads Are Ruining the App Store Hey, wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be cool if Apple didn&amp;rsquo;t show the app I&amp;rsquo;m searching for both as a giant ad and as a search result?1
Ads are ruining Apple&amp;rsquo;s App Store. I understand that Crunchy Bagel, the app developer, is not to blame. I genuinely adore Streaks and all of the other apps they offer. You should definitely check them out.&amp;#160;&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;</description>

      <description>Apple Watch Update You can resume the download when you are connected to a Wi-Fi network.
Ookayâ€¦ So is the Watch app broken and unwilling to update. Or is my iPhone lying to me and Iâ€™m not connected to Wi-Fi?
Apple Watch requires Wi-Fi to update. </description>

      <title>ML-based Autocorrect Sucks</title>

      <description>ML-based Autocorrect Sucks I get wildly wrong predictions since Apple added machine learning-based predictions to its autocorrection/text completion. Why on earth would the German equivalent of â€žwell then itâ€™sâ€¦â€œ logically be completed to â€žiStateOfMind3â€œ ðŸ¤·? I donâ€™t have an app with that name installed, and as far as I know, I never had one.
