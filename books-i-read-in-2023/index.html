  <p>Continuing from <a href="https://s1999u2.github.io/books-i-read-in-2022/">Books I Read in 2022</a>, I want to provide a brief overview of the books I read in 2023.

As an agonizingly slow reader, my go-to choice for the past two years has been audiobooks. I anticipate a less hectic 2024, so I&rsquo;m not setting a goal to read as many books this year.</p>

<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>Bill Bryson&rsquo;s &ldquo;A Walk in the Woods&rdquo; humorously recounts his journey along the Appalachian Trail, blending tales of its stunning scenery, history, and encounters with hikers and wildlife, especially bears. It&rsquo;s a compelling adventure story that evokes a deep appreciation for nature and the joy of exploration.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h4>
<p>The book provided an engaging and easy read while I meandered through the woods surrounding Tokyo. Although Bill Bryson writes in a relatively light manner and some incidents appear too perfect to be factual, it serves as a pleasant diversion. Moreover, it certainly evokes a desire for hiking.</p>

<h4 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Notes from a Small Island&rdquo; by Bill Bryson humorously documents his goodbye journey across Britain, highlighting the country&rsquo;s peculiarities and charms through satirical and affectionate commentary on its culture and oddly named places.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-1">Thoughts</h4>
<p>A brief journey back in time to the United Kingdom of 30 years ago. Entertaining, yet somewhat drier than the aforementioned book. Perhaps the performance of the German narrator bothered me too much (I did not have access to another version).</p>

<h4 id="abstract-2">Abstract</h4>
<p>In his book, Bill Bryson delves into Christmas traditions, uncovering the origins of Boxing Day, &ldquo;Good King Wenceslas,&rdquo; Christmas crackers, a Welsh folksong turned carol, and the evolution of St. Nicholas into Santa Claus. He reveals surprising histories behind these customs, offering insights into the world&rsquo;s biggest annual celebration.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-2">Thoughts</h4>
<p>Christmas is a wonderful time of the year, before winter becomes truly uncomfortable, cold, wet, muddy, and dark. The book is quite short (who doesn&rsquo;t find it unbearable when an interesting essay idea has to be inflated into an 800-page book?). It&rsquo;s definitely a fun collection of amusing facts and trivia about Christmas, though it&rsquo;s also a bit random.</p>

<h4 id="abstract-3">Abstract</h4>
<p>&ldquo;We Have No Idea&rdquo; by Jorge Cham and Daniel Whiteson delves into the mysteries of the universe with humor and clear explanations, tackling unsolved cosmological questions and simplifying complex scientific concepts. It&rsquo;s an engaging read for those fascinated by the mysteries of physics.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-3">Thoughts</h4>
<p>Though I&rsquo;ve always had a fondness for <a href="https://phdcomics.com">PhD Comics</a> (and I&rsquo;ve just finished my PhD, I might add), I found this book less exciting to read than the topic would have led me to believe. Perhaps it leaned too much into the &ldquo;isn&rsquo;t this just unbelievable? We have absolutely no idea&rdquo; angle and was also quite superficial in terms of its technical depth (I&rsquo;m an engineer by training, but still found the book to lack depth).</p>

<h4 id="abstract-4">Abstract</h4>
<p>In &ldquo;Rainbow Six,&rdquo; Tom Clancy showcases John Clark, an ex-Navy SEAL, leading an international anti-terrorism squad through a series of global crises. As they investigate seemingly unrelated incidents, they uncover a terrifying connection leading to a deadly terrorist group that poses a threat to humanity itself. Clancy&rsquo;s intricate plotting and deep character exploration make &ldquo;Rainbow Six&rdquo; a standout in his collection, offering a gripping narrative on the complexities of global terrorism.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-4">Thoughts</h4>
<p>I listened to the audiobook version while exploring various parts of Yokohama and Tokyo on foot. For this purpose, it was an ideal auditory companion, as it didn&rsquo;t require too much attention (not a technical book) and it&rsquo;s relatively long (Tokyo is <em>very</em> big). Although I found the book overall entertaining, it must be said honestly that the story is not very profound, and it&rsquo;s rather soaked with flat stereotypes like vegan eco-terrorists.</p>
<p>As a child, I found the Rainbow Six video games (and all other Tom Clancy games) incredibly cool, so I bought the book in English in my early youth. Understandably, I had neither the vocabulary nor the stamina to read the book at that time - so I was glad to have finally read/heard it after all these years. Maybe I should watch the movie <em>The Hunt for Red October</em>&hellip;</p>

<h4 id="abstract-5">Abstract</h4>
<p>Jonathan Clements succinctly narrates Japan&rsquo;s history from its ancient origins to its current global prominence. Highlighting its evolution from a mysterious land of divine emperors to a symbol of the East&rsquo;s allure, Clements explores Japan&rsquo;s journey through isolation, conflict, and rejuvenation. Despite its contradictions, Japan remains a land rich in history, culture, and industrial prowess, offering insights into both its past and its role in shaping the future.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-5">Thoughts</h4>
<p>I listened to the book in preparation for <a href="https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/12327/123270D/Noise-robust-registration-of-microscopic-height-data-using-convolutional-neural/10.1117/12.2644620.short#_=_">my conference</a> in Japan.

<h4 id="abstract-6">Abstract</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Culture Heist&rdquo; by Rebecca Giblin and Cory Doctorow critiques Big Tech and Big Media&rsquo;s dominance, showing how it harms creators and workers. They offer strategies for resistance, advocating transparency rights, collective action, and fair contracts to counter monopolistic power and promote equity in the digital age.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-6">Thoughts</h4>
<p>One of my favorite books from last year centers around the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification"><em>Enshittification</em></a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is how platforms die:
First, they are good to their users;
then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers;
finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves.
Then, they die.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you understand this mechanism, what was once a vague observation and feeling over time becomes clear and tangible—if there&rsquo;s a word for it, it suddenly becomes a thing. And we all know Enshittification from countless examples. Nonetheless, the book is worth reading beyond the central idea, as the case studies provide interesting insights. Highly recommended!</p>

<h4 id="abstract-7">Abstract</h4>
<p>&ldquo;The Bible Unearthed&rdquo; by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Asher Silberman reexamines biblical narratives using archaeology, suggesting many stories are symbolic rather than historically accurate. Their analysis challenges traditional interpretations and explores the scriptures&rsquo; enduring emotional impact.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-7">Thoughts</h4>
<p>I discovered this book through the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@UsefulCharts">UsefulCharts</a> channel. Having been raised in a Christian environment as a child, it was interesting to gain a well-researched and fact-based perspective on the biblical world and its stories. However, I must say that the book is quite detailed, and I found it challenging not to get overwhelmed by the plethora of facts and data.</p>

<h4 id="abstract-9">Abstract</h4>
<p>In his concise bestseller, James Hawes provides an accessible overview of Germany&rsquo;s history, from Julius Caesar to Angela Merkel. With over 100 maps and images, the book is designed for easy reading, offering entertainment and insight into centuries of complex history. Hawes challenges perceptions of Germans as either &ldquo;us&rdquo; or &ldquo;them,&rdquo; aiming to demystify German history and culture while offering a fresh perspective on Europe&rsquo;s most admired and feared nation.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-9">Thoughts</h4>
<p>Although I live in Germany and have grown up and attended school here, we learned relatively little about &ldquo;the big picture&rdquo; of German history (or the peoples who lived in this area in the past) in history class. The focus was often on specific periods or other countries, such as the Nazi era, the French Revolution, and again the Nazi era (the processing of the crimes of World War II is still omnipresent nearly 80 years after the war ended). Towards the end of the book, as it approaches the present day and thus also the period I have experienced myself, I&rsquo;m not sure if I can agree with the author, but I believe this is a general problem with viewing history. The picture, or at least the narrative, often becomes clearer with some temporal distance from the events, for various reasons.</p>

<h4 id="abstract-10">Abstract</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Dealers of Lightning&rdquo; by Michael Hiltzik uncovers the pioneering innovations at Xerox&rsquo;s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) in the 1970s, laying the groundwork for the digital revolution. Hiltzik celebrates the creativity of the PARC team, who developed early versions of the internet, personal computers, and user-friendly software, despite Xerox&rsquo;s limited recognition. Through interviews with those involved, the book sets the record straight on their significant contributions to tech history.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-10">Thoughts</h4>

<h4 id="abstract-11">Abstract</h4>
<p>In this book, a technology columnist from Newsweek explores the origin and rise to popularity of the iPod. The author discusses Apple&rsquo;s unexpected success in the technology industry, the iPod&rsquo;s impact on the music industry, and the pivotal role played by CEO Steve Jobs and his team in revolutionizing the way music is consumed. With a first printing of 100,000 copies, the book provides insights into the cultural and technological significance of the iPod.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-11">Thoughts</h4>
<p>While not the most factual book, <em>The Perfect Thing</em> is an ode to the aesthetic and conceptual uniqueness of the iPod, as well as the revolution it sparked in personal consumer technology. <em>Everyone</em> in my school wanted one, and every manufacturer tried to somehow copy it but never succeeded. Detractors have dismissed Apple as overpriced designer tech with no meaningful functions since those days, but its relevance to the world, and particularly to a new Apple that would later culminate in the iPhone, is undeniable.
(And although I would have killed for my own iPod, it wasn&rsquo;t until the iPod Touch in 2008 that I had saved enough money to afford one - what a device!)</p>

<h4 id="abstract-12">Abstract</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Prisoners of Geography&rdquo; by Tim Marshall examines how geography shapes global geopolitics. Marshall illustrates how physical features influence nations&rsquo; strengths and vulnerabilities, offering clear insights into topics like Russia&rsquo;s naval challenges, China&rsquo;s constraints, and Europe&rsquo;s disunity. The book sheds light on geography&rsquo;s significant role in shaping world history and politics.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-12">Thoughts</h4>
<p>This book presents a novel, clear, and understandable idea to me: geography influences politics. I wish it had been condensed into an essay rather than expanded into a thick book. While the numerous examples are interesting, one grasps the core idea quite quickly.</p>

<h4 id="abstract-13">Abstract</h4>
<p>In his latest book, Tim Marshall examines ten regions shaping global politics, from Australia to Space. With wit and insight, he reveals why Europe faces a refugee crisis, the Middle East must diversify beyond oil, and the eastern Mediterranean is volatile. Marshall also discusses the Earth&rsquo;s atmosphere as a future battleground. Peter Frankopan praises Marshall&rsquo;s ability to distill essential knowledge, making this book another outstanding guide to the modern world.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-13">Thoughts</h4>

<h4 id="abstract-15">Abstract</h4>
<p>&ldquo;Expecting Better&rdquo; by Emily Oster challenges pregnancy recommendations with evidence-based insights, empowering women to make informed choices. It&rsquo;s a valuable resource for expecting mothers seeking a deeper understanding of their pregnancy journey.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-15">Thoughts</h4>
<p>The weakest book I read last year. Similar to financial guides (see below) or topics like nutrition, the field surrounding the topic of <em>children</em> also suffers from a poor signal-to-noise ratio; it&rsquo;s difficult or nearly impossible to find meaningful literature among all the charlatans, life coaches, and the &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you how it <em>really</em> works&rdquo; crowd. Emily Oster&rsquo;s book was recommended to me from several sources as <em>the</em> fact-based book that offers sensible advice based on evidence.
Unfortunately, it didn&rsquo;t work for me at all. To avoid going into a rage, I&rsquo;ll just say that I cannot recommend this book, and anyone looking for something meaningful on this topic will, regrettably, have to look elsewhere.</p>

<h4 id="abstract-29">Abstract</h4>
<p>Arno Luik&rsquo;s book exposes systemic failures and mismanagement in the Deutsche Bahn, including issues with lobbying, the Stuttgart 21 project, and unreliable services. Despite ample taxpayer funding, the company&rsquo;s performance continues to decline, posing risks to passenger safety. The critique demands accountability from those responsible for its governance.</p>
<h4 id="thoughts-29">Thoughts</h4>
<p>Ah, Deutsche Bahn. Deutsche Bahn is so unreliable and mismanaged that the lived reality has surpassed any jokes on the subject. Not to mention their pricing or app issues. And like many, I&rsquo;ve had my fair share of mild annoyances to rage-inducing follies with practically every journey.</p>
<p>I thought this book would technically describe the current state of affairs (dilapidated infrastructure, delays and cancellations, comparison with other countries, etc.), as well as the causes and background of the current situation.</p>
<p>Instead, with each page, this book turned more into a &ldquo;things were better in the past&rdquo; rant by an old white man who rejects any change or modernization.</p>

<p>Dystopian fiction is when you take things that happen in real life to marginalized populations and apply them to people with privilege.

</blockquote>
<p>If you want to gain a better understanding of how marginalized groups (in Germany) are also disadvantaged before the law, then this book is an eye-opening, yet saddening read. The modern constitutional state is a cultural achievement, and although it is often taken for granted, it should not be. However, a system should also be judged by how it treats the socially/financially weak and those who have no one to advocate for them or who have no voice.</p>
